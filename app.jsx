The main goal of the experiment was to examine how different concentrations of sucrose solution affect the rate of dialysis, used here as a substitute for osmosis across a cellular membrane, when that membrane contained solutions with varying concentrations.

Osmosis is often described as a type of diffusion, where molecules move from an area with higher concentration to one with lower concentration in order to reach equilibrium. In living cells, not only water but also solutes can pass through the selectively permeable cellular membrane—an aspect that adds a truly "animal-like" quality to our tubing model. To create suitable conditions for osmosis in our experimental setup, we needed realistic concentrations: low on one side of the tubing (as pure water contains few solutes) and high inside the tubing.

We hypothesized that model cells with higher sucrose concentrations would create a stronger osmotic gradient, leading to an increased inflow of water and resulting in greater mass gain. Our experimental data supported this hypothesis: the model cells with higher sucrose levels not only gained more mass but also exhibited a significantly faster rate of mass gain over time compared to control groups and those with lower sucrose concentrations. These results support osmosis theory, specifically the idea that larger concentration differentials enhance water movement across membranes.

The rate of osmosis was precisely determined by analyzing the slopes derived from mass-time graphs for each sucrose concentration. These slopes, expressed in grams per minute, represented the speed at which water entered the cell models due to osmotic processes. An overview of these slopes shows that for a 0 M sucrose solution there was virtually no slope, indicating an absence of water movement into or out of the model cells since there was no osmotic gradient present. For a 0.15 M sucrose solution, however, a slight increase in slope suggested that a minimal osmotic gradient allowed only small amounts of water to migrate into the cell models.

The sucrose solution with a concentration of 0.30 M demonstrated a moderate rate of osmosis, measuring 0.0167 grams per minute, as indicated by the relatively steep slope on the mass-time graph compared to solutions with lower concentrations. Given that this concentration was utilized in prior experiments, two higher concentrations—0.60 M and 1.20 M—were tested for better insight into osmosis rates across various sucrose levels. The slopes of their respective mass-time graphs suggested notably faster rates: the 0.60 M solution displayed a considerably steeper slope than that at 0.30 M indicating quicker osmosis; meanwhile, the gradient for the 1.20 M solution showed an even more rapid process.

This data demonstrates a strong correlation between sucrose concentration and the rate of osmosis in our experiment, supporting our hypothesis that an increased concentration gradient indeed accelerates the osmotic process. These results corroborate the theoretical foundations of osmosis, a concept originally introduced by botanist Henri Heren in 1867.

The mass change data presented here aid in enhancing our comprehension of concentration variations resulting from pure osmosis, occurring as solute moves to the solvent side. In this analysis, we examine three key metrics for each concentration: the final mass (recorded after 30 minutes), the initial mass (measured before initiating the process), and the percentage change in mass. The latter is calculated by subtracting the initial mass from the final mass and then dividing that value by the initial mass.

The three mass numbers for each concentration are represented in a set of histograms, illustrating a gradient relationship. Our goal is to direct the pure water toward the concentrated side of the gradient.

These patterns illustrate how osmotic gradients are utilized by biological systems to maintain cellular homeostasis. Plant cells sustain a nutrient transport mechanism that relies on osmosis, allowing them to absorb both water and solutes from their environment. This process occurs because the soil possesses a greater concentration of water and solutes compared to the plant cells. In this context, the soil is analogous to the solution in a beaker, while the plant cells correspond to what can be considered as control group conditions on its right side.

The hypothesis was thoroughly tested through the results obtained, but potential sources of error were also identified to enhance the reliability of these findings. Additionally, identifying these errors provides valuable insights for refining future experiments. The first major factor is measurement inaccuracy; limitations with the balance used to weigh model cells may have impacted mass measurements significantly. There was considerable variability in recorded masses, likely affecting osmosis rate calculations due to expected minor changes if everything functioned correctly—highlighting that consistent and accurate measurements are crucial for reliable outcomes in osmosis studies. Another possible source of error stems from inconsistencies during dialysis tubing preparation; variations here could alter system volume and internal osmotic pressure unintentionally influencing our results.The third recognized source potentially impacting outcomes includes room temperature deviations.In summary,the left side table illustrates factors which might substantially affect observed osmotic rates.

To improve experimental accuracy and gain deeper insights, several refinements can be implemented. One is to extend the observation period from 60 minutes to at least 120 minutes or more, allowing for a thorough assessment of whether cells in high-sucrose solutions genuinely reach an equilibrium state. This extended observation time could highlight any noticeable changes in osmosis as the concentration gradient diminishes. Since how osmosis appears to "slow down" at higher concentration differentials remains poorly understood, such observations might offer critical insight into whether this behavior has reached a plateau. Another refinement involves increasing the variety of sucrose concentrations used during experimentation by incorporating additional levels like 0.45 M, 0.75 M, and 1.0 M solutions. Employing a broader range with finer increments allows for more detailed analysis across varying points on the concentration gradient and may uncover non-linear relationships between osmotic rates and solute concentrations that have been previously overlooked.​ By capturing this comprehensive "osmotic story," we can better understand what truly governs water movement through cell membranes under these conditions.

The experiment successfully illustrated the impact of sucrose concentration on osmosis rates in model cells, confirming the hypothesis that solution concentration directly affects the osmotic gradient and consequently influences osmosis speed. Cells exposed to higher sucrose concentrations experienced a faster rate of osmosis than those subjected to lower concentrations, even when adjacent cells showed significant volume changes with less concentrated solutions, aiming to equalize the altered osmotic gradient. This experiment not only supported the central thesis but also emphasized how crucial osmosis is for cellular homeostasis—and by extension—the health and proper function of organisms containing these cells. Practically speaking, understanding these concepts enables professionals like doctors to help maintain physiological balance when normal fluid regulation mechanisms are bypassed or disrupted.
